The first official data release by the Indian Pulsar Timing Array.
Contains the pulse arrival times (ToAs), pulsar ephemerides and dispersion measure (DM) time series for 14 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) over a time baseline of 3.5 years (2018-2021).
The pulsars were observed using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) over 6 observation cycles (uGMRT Cycles 34,35,37-40) in Band 3 (300-500 MHz) and Band 5 (1260-1460 MHz) simultaneously by dividing the 30 radio antennae into subarrays operating as separate telescopes in parallel.

NOTE: The data will be made public after publication of the corresponding research article.
