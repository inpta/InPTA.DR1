The first official data release by the Indian Pulsar Timing Array.
Contains the pulse arrival times (ToAs) and dispersion measure (DM) time series for 14 millisecond pulsars (MSPs) over a time baseline of 3.5 years (2018-2021).
The pulsars were observed using the upgraded Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope (uGMRT) over 6 observation cycles (uGMRT Cycles 34,35,37-40) in Band 3 (300-500 MHz) and Band 5 (1260-1460 MHz) simultaneously by dividing the 30 radio antennae into parallel subarrays.
